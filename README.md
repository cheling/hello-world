# hello-world
It's begining!
It's my first time to use this tool. I feel much lost and stressful. Time was flying and it is my third years in the college, but
I learned nothing. Suddenly I think I must find a cadet job in this summer holiday in order to gain some experience to help my full-time job. However when facing requirments of those big companies, I feel helpless and fearsome: master JSP, Mysql, kown XHTML
,one of JavaScript, Python,php.... Â In a word, there is a long way to go.
